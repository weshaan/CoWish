This is our project from the HackTU 4.0 Hackathon organised by CCS, thapar. 
> An Open Innovation Idea

### Life is precious, either humans or animals. Then why is the sacred animal left stranded in the middle of nowhere? ###
Why is the animal once respected as Mother has now become a liability? 

To deal with this problem, we give our contribution by coming up with a website that revolves around the issue of stray cattles.
Our hack comes under open innovation, as we provide an environment to facilitate rescue of cows  by reporting unprotected cattle. This is a sustainable, evergreen model as the cows then source the raw materials for various go-products. 
We wish to improve the condition of cows by providing them shelter, welfare, promoting go products thus limitng market for slaughter industry too.
